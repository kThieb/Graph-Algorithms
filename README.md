 Implementations of various graph algorithms in Python

In this repository, the forward star representation is used to store graphs, which is a memory efficient way of storing graphs

The different algorithms implemented are:

Topological ordering
Breadth first search, depth first search
Dijkstra's algorithm for the Shortest Path with positive weights problem
A deque implementation of the Bellman Ford algorithm for the generalized Shortest Path Problem
Push relabel algorithm for the Maximum Flow problem
Successive shortest paths algorithm for the Minimum Cost Flow problem
Other algorithm I would like to implement are:

Kruskal's algorithm for the Minimum Span Tree problem
Tarjan's algorithm for Strongly Connected Components
